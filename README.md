It’s a warm Friday evening, and your favorite dev team has decided to unwind after a long week of coding.  
They’ve found a cozy spot by the lake, cocktails in hand, watching the sun dip below the horizon. The water glimmers, the sky reflects in hues of orange and pink, and laughter carries across the shore.  

You snap a photo — the scene looks perfect, almost like a postcard. But something about it feels… curious. Perhaps the lake remembers more than just the reflections of the sky. Maybe there’s a story hidden in the colors and angles, waiting for someone to notice.  

We like to unwind after a long week of coding, usually with cocktails by the lake. Somewhere around here, we left a trail for anyone who’s paying attention.  

## Clues to Find the Spot

1. **Look closely at the image you have.**  
   - Sometimes pictures hold more than just visuals.  (P.S. Download the image to see the entirety of it properly at once)

2. **Once you know the lake…**  
   - There’s a particular café/bar we like, right by the water.  
   - Its name flows like water. Think about the hints in the name.

3. **Final Step:**  
   - Search for cafés/bars around the lake using the hints above.  
   - When you find the right one, you’ll know the flag.  
   - Flag format: `flag{Name_With_Underscores}`

Enjoy the hunt! 🍹🌅  
And remember — devs leave clues, sometimes in plain sight, sometimes hidden in plain text.
