Hey there!  

If you’ve stumbled upon this repository, it means you’re curious — or maybe just nosy like us devs. Either way, welcome!  

We like to unwind after a long week of coding, usually with cocktails by the lake. Somewhere around here, we left a trail for anyone who’s paying attention.  

## Clues to Find the Spot

1. **Look closely at the image you have.**  
   - Sometimes pictures hold more than just visuals.  

2. **Once you know the lake…**  
   - There’s a particular bar we like, right by the water.  
   - Its name flows like water. Think about the hints in the name.

3. **Final Step:**  
   - Search for cafés/bars around the lake using the hints above.  
   - When you find the right one, you’ll know the flag.  
   - Flag format: `flag{Name_With_Underscores}`

Enjoy the hunt! 🍹🌅  
And remember — devs leave clues, sometimes in plain sight, sometimes hidden in plain text.
