# 👋 Hey there!

Oh wow, you actually found my GitHub — nice work! 🎉  
Welcome to **Pending-Project** (yeah… I know, I still haven’t finished it 😅).  

Since you’ve made it this far, let’s make this interesting:  
I’m currently off on vacation 🌍✈️.  
Can you figure out **where I am right now**?  

I like to unwind after a long week of coding, usually with cocktails by the lake. Somewhere around here, I've left a trail for anyone who’s paying attention.  

## Clues to Find the Spot

1. **Look closely at the image you have.**  
   - Sometimes pictures hold more than just visuals.  (P.S. Download the image to see the entirety of it properly at once)

2. **Once you know the lake…**  
   - There’s a particular café/bar I like, right by the water.  
   - Its name flows like water. Think about the hints in the name.
     
3. **What to look for:**  
   - Cocktails at sunset  
   - Lakeside view  
   - Something in the name that suggests water
     
4. **Final Step:**  
   - Search for cafés/bars around the lake using the hints above.  
   - When you find the right one, you’ll know the flag.  
   - Flag format: `ACM{Name_With_Underscores}`

Enjoy the hunt! 🍹🌅
